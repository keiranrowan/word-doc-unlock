# word-doc-unlock

Just a simple script thrown together to remove passwords off of many word files. Edited from a snippet I found in the depths of a MS forum. I added some logging, sorting, and error checking.  Putting it here in case anyone needs it. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation feel free to use!
